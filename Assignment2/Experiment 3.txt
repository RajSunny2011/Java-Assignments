1) Given an integer array nums of size n, find the maximum and minimum elements in the array and return them as a pair.
Example:
Input: nums = [1, 5, 7, 2, 9, 3]
     Output: [9, 1]

2) Given an array  of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than 
[n / 2] times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
Example:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

3) Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Example:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

4) Given a string s, reverse the words of the string.
Example 1:
Input: s=”This is decent”
Output: “decent is This”
