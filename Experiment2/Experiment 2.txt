2. Write a Java program that calculates the electricity bill based on the number of units consumed by a user. The electricity charges are determined as follows:
* For consumption between 1 and 100 units, the cost is Rs 5 per unit.
* For consumption between 101 and 200 units, the cost is Rs 7 per unit.
* For consumption between 201 and 300 units, the cost is Rs 10 per unit.
* For consumption exceeding 300 units, the cost is Rs 15 per unit.
The program should:
1. Take the total units consumed as input.
2. Calculate the total electricity bill based on the charges above.
3. Display the total electricity bill.
Example Input/Output:
* Input: 150
* Output: The total electricity bill is Rs 850.

3. Write a program to find the area of a shape (Rectangle, Square, Circle, Triangle) using method overloading.

4. Write a Java program that takes an operator (+, -, *, /, %) and two numbers as input from the user. Use a switch statement to perform the specified operation and display the result.
